# Airplane-Seating-Algorithm written in Python
• Always	seat	passengers	star:ng	from	the	front	row	to	back,	
starting	from	the	left	to	the	right	
• Fill	aisle	seats	first	followed	by	window	seats	followed	by	center	
seats	(any	order	in	center	seats)	
space complexity is O(rows*columns) O(mn), time complexity is O(n^3) according to the for loops.
